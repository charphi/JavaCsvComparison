name: Open Quotation (violating RFC 4180)
description: >-
  RFC 4180 section 2.5 specifies:
  "Each field may or may not be enclosed in double quotes".
  
  A parser should either stop parsing when quotation marks are not appearing in the right places or treat them according to these rules.
settings:
  exceptionAllowed: true
checks:
  - id: open-quotation-1
    input: 'A,"B'
    description: >-
      A regular, unquoted field `A`, followed by a field that starts with a quotation mark, followed by the letter `B` and then ended by end of data.
      As the quotation mark in CSV is not allowed for any other purpose than enclosing fields, the parser should treat this as an open quotation and not part of the field.
    records:
      - [ 'A', 'B' ]
  - id: open-quotation-2
    input: '"A,B'
    description: >-
      A line that starts with a quotation mark, followed by some arbitrary data and then ended by end of data.
      As the quotation mark in CSV is not allowed for any other purpose than enclosing fields, the parser should treat this as an open quotation and not part of the field.
    records:
      - [ 'A,B' ]
  - id: open-quotation-3
    input: 'A,B"'
    description: >-
      A regular, unquoted field `A`, followed by a field that ends with a quotation mark and then ended by end of data.
      As the second field didn't start with a quotation mark, the parser should treat this as a regular field and not part of an open quotation. The quotation mark after the `B` should be treated as a regular character.
    records:
      - [ 'A', 'B"' ]
