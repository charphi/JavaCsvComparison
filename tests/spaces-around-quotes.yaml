name: Spaces around quotes
description: >-
  RFC 4180-bis section 3.6. specifies:
  "When quoted fields are used, this document does not allow whitespace between double quotes and commas.
  Implementers should be aware that some applications may be more lenient and allow whitespace outside the double quotes."
  
  Implementors should either reject to further process the file or should handle the whitespaces as this test suite does.
